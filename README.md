# Machine Learning Project

Project developed for the course of Machine Learning during the first semester of the Master's degree in Data Science and Advanced Analytics.

This project was built from a fictitious problem (attempt to predict if citizens will earn above or below average salaries in a human colony on another planet), but based on a real dataset. The main goal was to properly classify citizens according to the wage group they will belong to in the new planet, in order to be able to define a proper tax policy. 

Here you can find the jupyter notebook written in Python, and the report delivered. The notebook contains all steps followed in order to process the data and to construct the to optimize and test the models developed.
